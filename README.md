In the WordPress post-Gutenberg world there are fundamental shifts in both user and development workflows, and moving forward that means how we develop themes will also change. Let’s look at the current status of theme development, how you can get started taking advantage of the core editor right now and how we can begin building themes for the future. Specifically, we’ll cover:

    * How to modify existing themes to take full advantage of the new editor and blocks.
    * What’s the difference between Block Enabled and Block Based Themes.
    * What’s the difference between Block Patterns and Block Templates.
    * Creating Block Templates and Block Patterns.
    * On the Horizon: Full Site Editing and Global Styles and how this will affect theme development.
